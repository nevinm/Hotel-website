                        <p class='section-text break'> Welcome to Meisterdish, located at Meisterdish.com (our website)! Please read these Terms of Use (these “Terms”) carefully because they govern your use of our websites, mobile applications or blogs (collectively, the “Sites”) and the other services and products we provide via our Sites. Note that “Dispute Resolution” of these Terms contains a mandatory arbitration provision that requires the use of arbitration on an individual basis and limits the remedies available to you in the event of certain disputes.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class='section-subheading'>Agreement to Terms </p>
                        <p class='section-text break'>By using our Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not access or use the Sites or order, receive or use the meal ingredients or other services and products made available through the Sites (collectively, the “Services”).</p>
                        <p class='section-text break'> These Terms do not alter in any way the terms or conditions of any other agreement you may have with us in respect of any products, services or otherwise. If you are accessing and using the Services on behalf of a company (such as your employer) or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that company or other legal entity to these Terms. In that case, “you” and “your” will refer to that company or other legal entity.</p>
                        <p class='section-subheading'>Changes to Terms or Services</p>
                        <p class='section-text break'> We may modify these Terms at any time, in our sole discretion. If we do so, we’ll let you know either by posting the modified Terms on the Site or through other communications. It’s important that you review the Terms whenever we modify them because if you continue to use the Services after we have posted modified Terms on the Site or have communicated them to you, you are indicating to us that you agree to be bound by the modified Terms. If you don’t agree to be bound by the modified Terms, then you can’t use the Services anymore. Because our Services are evolving over time we may change or discontinue all or any part of the Services, at any time and without notice, at our sole discretion.</p>
                        <p class='section-subheading break'>Who May Use the Services</p>
                        <p class='section-subheading'>Eligibility</p>
                        <p class='section-text break'> You may use the Services only if you are at least 18 years old and capable of forming a binding contract with Meisterdish and are not barred from using the Services under applicable law. If you’re under 18 years old, you may not use any of our Services.
                        </p>
                        <p class='section-subheading'>Registration and Your Information </p>
                        <p class='section-text break'>If you want to use certain features of the Services you’ll have to create an account (“Account”). You can do this on our Site or through your account with certain third-party social networking services, such as Facebook (an “SNS Account”). If you choose the SNS Account option, we’ll create your Account by extracting from your SNS Account certain personal information, such as your name, email address, and other personal information that your privacy settings on the SNS Account permit us to access. It’s important that you provide us with accurate, complete, and up-to-date information for your Account, so you agree to update such information, as needed, to keep it accurate, complete, and up-to-date. If you don’t, we might have to suspend or terminate your Account. You agree that you won’t disclose your Account password to anyone and that you’ll notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your Account. You’re responsible for all activities that occur under your Account, whether or not you know about them, so please keep your password secret and secure.</p>
                        <p class='section-text break'>We want to keep all our users safe and happy, so we reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to disable, suspend, cancel, or delete any Account for any reason, or to refuse any user access to any of our Services, if we think doing so will help keep things safe and enjoyable for everybody. </p>
                        <p class='section-subheading'>Privacy Policy </p>
                        <p class='section-text break'>Please refer to our Privacy Policy for information on how we collect, use, and disclose your information. </p>
                        <p class='section-subheading'>The Services</p>
                        <p class='section-text '> We provide a platform through which users can buy quality meal kits and food items (the “Meals”) at fixed prices. We want you to love not just the Meals you find on our Site but also the whole experience you get from using our Services. We’re confident that you’ll love Meisterdish, but please understand that you use our Services at your own risk. You agree to hold us, as well as our officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries, joint venturers, and employees (jointly and severally, our “Affiliates”) not liable, to the full extent permissible under all applicable law, for any harm, loss, or damage that may come to you or to anyone else as a consequence of your use of our Services.</p>
                        <p class='section-text break'> When you buy a Meal through any of our Services (such purchase, a “Transaction”), we may ask you to supply additional information relevant to your Transaction, including, without limitation, your credit-card number, the expiration date of your credit card, and your address(es) for billing and delivery (such information, “Payment Information”). You represent and warrant that you have the legal right to use all payment method(s) represented by any such Payment Information, whether you provide it in the course of a Transaction or in connection with your Account. When you initiate a Transaction, you authorize us to provide your Payment Information to third parties so we can complete your Transaction; you may need to provide additional information to verify your identity before completing your Transaction (such information is included within the definition of Payment Information).
                        </p>
                        <p class='section-text'>All sales are final. But if something unexpected happens in the course of fulfilling your order, we reserve the right to cancel your order for any reason; if we cancel your order, we’ll refund any payment you may already have remitted to us.</p>
                        <p class='section-text'> We make a conscientious effort to describe and display every Meal accurately on our Site. Because all our Meals are home cooked by you, however, occasionally a Meal you receive won’t look or taste exactly as it was described or depicted to you. You understand that this is normal, and you agree to accept such a Meal, regardless of reasonable variation from its description or depiction. We can’t and don’t guarantee the accuracy or completeness of any description or depiction of any Meal. We reserve the right to change or update any such description or depiction and to correct errors, inaccuracies, or omissions at any time without giving you notice.</p>
                        <p class='section-text'> We can’t guarantee that every Meal will arrive exactly within the timeframe we give you when you initiate a Transaction. If a Meal arrives early or late, you agree that you will still accept the Meal and release us from all liability for any loss, damage, or inconvenience that you encounter as a result of early or late delivery.</p>
                        <p class='section-text break'> If you have a complaint or dispute concerning a Meal you’ve purchased through our Services, please contact us, and we’ll try to fix the problem in the manner we deem appropriate, in our discretion.</p>
                        <p class='section-subheading'>Pricing and Availability</p>
                        <p class='section-text break'>All prices are shown in U.S. dollars and applicable taxes and other charges, if any, are additional. We reserve the right to adjust prices as we may determine in our sole discretion, at any time and without notice. </p>
                        <p class='section-text break'>All of our Products are subject to availability, and we reserve the right to impose quantity limits on any Order, to reject all or part of an Order, to discontinue offering certain Products and to substitute Products (including, but not limited to, specific meal ingredients or entire meals) without prior notice. We strive to provide you with high-quality Products, and given the perishable nature of certain Products and market conditions beyond our control, we may be required to make substitutions from time to time. If you are not satisfied with a substitution, please contact us at contact@meisterdish.com.</p>
                        <p class='section-subheading'> Taxes</p>
                        <p class='section-text break'> We will collect applicable sales tax on Products.</p>
                        <p class='section-subheading'> Deliveries </p>
                        <p class='section-text break'>You are responsible for inspecting all Products you receive from us for any damage or other issues upon delivery. In addition, you are solely responsible for determining the freshness of the Products you receive. You should always inspect your delivery to confirm that the meal ingredients arrive in a cool, refrigerated condition. We recommend that you use a thermometer to ensure that the temperature zone within the container in which any meat, poultry or seafood Product is located is 40° F or below. In the unlikely event that such temperature zone is above 40° F, or you have any other reason to believe that any other Product in your delivery is not suitable for consumption, contact us at contact@meisterdish.com and discard the item. To maintain the quality and integrity of the Products, we recommend that you immediately refrigerate all perishable Products upon delivery and follow the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (“USDA”) instructions on refrigeration and food safety, which can be foundhere. From the time of delivery, the condition and consumption of the Products are solely at your risk, and you are solely responsible for the proper and safe washing, handling, preparation, storage, cooking, use and consumption of the Products following delivery. We recommend that you follow the USDA’s instructions on safe food handling, which can be found here. We also recommend that all cooking instructions be followed and that you use a food thermometer to ensure that all meat, poultry, seafood and other applicable items are cooked to the USDA’s recommended internal temperatures, which can be found here. Failure to follow safe food handling practices and temperature recommendations may increase the risk of foodborne illness. In addition, pregnant women, young children, the elderly and individuals with compromised immune systems should follow the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s recommendations on food consumption for at-risk groups, which can be found here.</p>
                        <p class='section-text break'> If you are not at home when your delivery arrives, we generally cannot deliver. Due to the freshness and on demand delivery, we will need to cancel your order without any refund. In certain areas, you may be able to provide additional delivery instructions when checking out, such as requesting that your delivery be left with a doorman or neighbor. Any individual at the delivery address who accepts a delivery from us is presumed to be authorized to receive such delivery. In cases in which you have designated an alternative receiver, such person shall accept the delivery under all of the same terms and conditions that would apply had you accepted the delivery yourself.</p>
                        <p class='section-text break'> In the case of inclement weather or other events beyond our control that interfere with our ability to deliver your Order, we will attempt to deliver your Order as soon as reasonably possible. In the event that timely delivery of your meal ingredients is not feasible, we will cancel your meal delivery and issue you a credit or refund of the purchase price for that meal delivery.</p>
                        <p class='section-subheading'>Referral Programs</p>
                        <p class='section-text break'>From time to time, we may offer referral programs or incentives for inviting others to use the Service (a "Referral Program"). Any bonuses or incentives under such Referral Program shall be subject to the then current Referral Program terms and at our sole discretion.</p>
                        <p class='section-subheading'>Text Alerts</p>

                            <p class='section-text break'>
                                The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by this “Dispute Resolution” section. (The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org/arb_med or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.
                            </p>
                            <p class='section-subheading'>Arbitration Process</p>
                            <p class='section-text'>
                                A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at http://www.adr.org/aaa/Showcsv?doc=ADRSTG_015820.) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules. </p>
                            <p class='section-subheading'>
                                Arbitration Location and Procedure</p>
                            <p class='section-text break'>
                                Unless you and we otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and we submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.</p>
                            <p class='section-subheading'>Arbitrator’s Decision </p>
                            <p class='section-text break'>
                                The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator’s award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the “Limitation of Liability” section above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. We will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.</p>
                            <p class='section-subheading'>Fees</p>
                            <p class='section-text break'>
                                Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, we will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).</p>

                        <p class='section-text break'>
                            Welcome to Meisterdish! Protecting your privacy is really important to us. Accordingly, we’re providing this Privacy Policy to explain our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information that we receive when you use our Services. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party websites, services, or applications, even if they are accessible through our Services. Any information that we collect is subject to the privacy policy in effect at the time that Information is collected. We may, however, modify and revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we’ll notify you of those changes by posting them on the Services or by sending you an email or other notification, and we’ll indicate when those changes will become effective. Finally, please note that, unless we define a term in this Privacy Policy, all capitalized words used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms of Service.</p>
                        <p class='section-heading'>How We Collect and Use Information</p>
                        <p class='section-text break'>
                            Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Services, to administer your use of the Services (including your Account, if you are an Account holder), and to enable you to enjoy and easily navigate our Services. We also use some of your PII to contact you, as described in our Terms of Service. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in the applicable communications. There are, however, some administrative communications that we have to send you from time to time, from which you cannot unsubscribe. </p>
                        <p class='section-heading'> Account Information</p>
                        <p class='section-text break'>
                            If you create an Account, we’ll collect certain information that can be used to identify you, such as your name, email address, postal address, phone number, and credit-card number or other billing information (“PII”). If you create an Account using your login credentials from one of your SNS Accounts, we’ll be able to access and collect your name and email address and other PII that your privacy settings on the SNS Account permit us to access. If you create an Account through the Site or one of your SNS Accounts, we may also collect your date of birth, ZIP code, and other information that is not considered PII because it can’t be used by itself to identify you. We don’t receive or store passwords for any of your SNS Accounts.</p>
                        <p class='section-heading'>Information Collected Using Cookies and other Web Technologies</p>
                        <p class='section-text'>
                            Like many website and mobile-application operators, we use automated data collection tools such as Cookies and Web Beacons to collect certain information.</p>
                        <p class='section-text break'>
                            “Cookies” are small text files that are placed on your hard drive by a Web server when you access our Services. We may use Cookies to identify that you’ve logged in to the Services and to tell us how and when you interact with our Services. We may also use Cookies to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on our Services and to customize and improve our Services. Although most browsers automatically accept Cookies, you can change your browser options to stop automatically accepting Cookies or to prompt you before accepting Cookies. Please note, however, that if you don’t accept Cookies, you may not be able to access all portions or features of the Services. Some third-party services providers that we engage (including third-party advertisers) may also place their own Cookies on your hard drive. Note that this Privacy Policy covers only our use of Cookies and does not include use of Cookies by such third parties.</p>
                        <p class='section-text break'>
                            “Web Beacons” (also known as clear gifs or) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that may be included on our Services for several purposes, including to deliver or communicate with Cookies, to track and measure the performance of our Services, to monitor how many visitors view our Services, and to monitor the effectiveness of our advertising. Unlike Cookies, which are stored on your hard drive, Web Beacons are typically embedded invisibly on web pages (or in an e-mail).</p>
                        <p class='section-heading'>Information Related to Use of the Services</p>
                        <p class='section-text break'>
                            Our servers automatically record certain information about how a person uses our Services (we refer to this information as “Log Data”), including both Account holders and non-Account holders (either, a “User”). Log Data may include information such as a User’s Internet Protocol address (“IP Address”), browser type, operating system, the web page that a User was visiting before accessing our Services, the pages or features of our Services to which a User browsed and the time spent on those pages or features, search terms, the links on our Services that a User clicked on, and other statistics. We use this information to administer the Services, and we analyze (and may engage third parties to analyze) this information to improve and enhance the Services by expanding their features and functionality and tailoring them to our Users’ needs and preferences. We use the IP Address to generate aggregate, non-identifying information about how our Services are used. </p>
                        <p class='section-heading'>Information Sent by Your Mobile Device</p>
                        <p class='section-text break'>
                            We collect certain information that your mobile device sends when you use our Services, such as a device identifier, user settings, and the operating system of your device, as well as information about your use of our Services.</p>
                        <p class='section-heading'> Location Information</p>
                        <p class='section-text break'>
                            In some cases we collect and store information about where you are located, such as by converting your IP address into a rough geolocation or through GPS or sensor data from your device that provides information on nearby Wi-Fi access points and cell towers to locate your mobile device. We may use location information to improve and personalize our Services for you. If you do not want us to collect location information, you can disable that feature on your mobile device.</p>
                        <p class='section-heading'>How We Share Information with Third Parties </p>
                        <p class='section-text break'>
                            We will not share any PII that we have collected from you except as described below:</p>
                        <p class='section-heading'>
                            Information Shared with Our Services Providers </p>
                        <p class='section-text break'>
                            We may engage third-party service providers to work with us to administer and provide the Services, such as to deliver Meals you order. Such third-party service providers have access to your PII only for the purpose of performing services on our behalf and are expressly obligated not to disclose or use your PII for any other purpose.</p>
                        <p class='section-heading'>
                            Information Shared with Third Parties</p>
                        <p class='section-text break'>
                            We may share aggregated information and non-identifying information with third parties for industry research and analysis, demographic profiling, and other similar purposes. </p>
                        <p class='section-heading'>
                            Information Disclosed in Connection with Business Transactions </p>
                        <p class='section-text break'>
                            Information that we collect from you, including PII, is considered to be a business asset. As a result, if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy or if we are acquired as a result of a transaction such as a merger, acquisition or asset sale, your PII may be disclosed or transferred to the third-party acquirer in connection with the transaction.</p>
                        <p class='section-heading'>
                            Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others </p>
                        <p class='section-text break'>
                            We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials or private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate: (i) to respond to claims, legal process (including subpoenas); (ii) to protect our property, rights and safety and the property, rights and safety of a third party or the public in general; and (iii) to stop any activity that we consider illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.</p>
                        <p class='section-heading'>
                            Information We Disclose With Your Consent or at Your Request </p>
                        <p class='section-text break'>
                            We will share your PII with third-party sites or platforms, such as social networking sites, if you have expressly requested that we do so.</p>
                        <p class='section-heading'>
                            Security of Your Information </p>
                        <p class='section-text break'>
                            We take reasonable measures to protect the information that we collect from or about you (including your PII) from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. Please be aware, however, that no method of transmitting information over the Internet or storing information is completely secure. Accordingly, we can’t guarantee the absolute security of any information.</p>
                        <p class='section-text break'>
                            Identity theft and “phishing” are of great concern to us. Safeguarding your information to help protect you is a top priority for us. We won’t ever request any PII from you through unsolicited emails, text messages, or phone calls, so please don’t try to provide your PII to us except through our official Site. If you suspect someone is trying to obtain your PII by impersonating us or misleading you or other members of our community about the suspect person’s relationship to us or to our Services, please contact us at contact@meisterdish.com.</p>

                        <p class='section-text break'>
                            Our Services may contain links to other websites and services. Any information that you provide on or to a third-party website or service is provided directly to the owner of the website or service and is subject to that party’s privacy policy. Our Privacy Policy does not apply to such websites or services, and we’re not responsible for the content, privacy or security practices and policies of those websites or services. To protect your information we recommend that you carefully review the privacy policies of other websites and services that you access.</p>

If you want us to delete your PII and your Account, please contact us at contact@meisterdish.com with your request. We’ll take steps to delete your information as soon as is practicable, but some information may remain in archived/backup copies for our records or as otherwise required by law. </p>
